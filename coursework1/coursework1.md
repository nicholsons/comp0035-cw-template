# COMP0035 coursework 1

Check that you have included the following and used the correct filenames. Automated scripts are used to collate files for marking and if you change the filename your work will be missed.

Non-code files may be submitted as markdown (.md), as a document (.pdf), or audio file (.mp3). Do not submit video. Audio is intended as an alternative for those who express themselves more effectively in speech than in text.

Do not include your name in the files.

- data.py - a single Python file with all code for the data prep and understanding
- data.(pdf / md / mp3) - a single file for the data prep and understanding section
- dataset.(csv / xlsx) - your original dataset
- dataset_prepared.(csv / xlsx) - your prepared dataset
- product.(pdf / md / mp3) - a single file for the product overview and target audience section
- tools.(pdf / md / mp3) - a single file for the software engineering tools and techniques section

If you have an unusually large dataset it may exceed the file size limit for GitHub. [See guidance here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github) to address this.
