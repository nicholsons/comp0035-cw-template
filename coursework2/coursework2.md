# COMP0035 coursework 2

Check that you have included the following and used the correct filenames. Automated scripts are used to collate files for marking and if you change the filename your work will be missed.

Non-code files may be submitted as markdown (.md), as a document (.pdf), or audio file (.mp3). Do not submit video. Audio is intended as an alternative for those who express themselves more effectively in speech than in text.

Do not include your name in the files.

- `requirements.`(pdf / md / mp3) - a single file for the requirements analysis section
- `design.`(pdf / md / mp3) - a single file for the design section
- `tools.`(pdf / md / mp3) - a single file for the software engineering tools and techniques section
